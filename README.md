# Explore-US-BikeShare
## Project Overview
In this project, we will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. we will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. we will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Project Details
The program takes user input for the city (e.g. Chicago), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. May; also includes an 'all' option for no month filter), and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Sunday; also includes an 'all' option for no day filter). Upon receiving the user input, it goes ahead and asks the user if they want to view the raw data (5 rows of data initially) or not. Following the input received, the program prints the following details:

Most popular month
Most popular day
Most popular hour
Most popular start station
Most popular end station
Most popular combination of start and end stations
Total trip duration time
Average trip duration time
Maximum trip duration time
Minimum trip duration time
Types of users by number
Types of users by gender (if available) - The oldest user (if available) -
The youngest user (if available)
The most common birth year amongst users (if available)
Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.
